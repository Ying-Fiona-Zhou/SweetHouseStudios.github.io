            Sweet House Studio was founded in 2025 as a private, one-woman business built on a dream to capture the sweetest
            moments of life.

            Founder Fiona Chou has been passionate about photography since 2016 and began her professional journey in 2025. 
            After moving to Metuchen, NJ in 2024, Fiona laid the foundation for Sweet House Studio with the hope of turning 
            fleeting moments into lasting memories.

            Although still in the early stages of building the business, Sweet House Studio is rooted in the belief that 
            every smile, every hug, every connection deserves to be treasured.
