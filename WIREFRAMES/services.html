              We've become quite renowned for our event photography, so much so that we needed to develop separate <a
                href="events.html">event</a> and <a href="Travelings.html">traveling</a> packages. Session costs start at
              $400, depending on the number of shots, overall session duration, and the number of subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our most basic package begins at 50 edited proofs; speak with a consultant to see how much it would cost
              for your perfect session.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the location is greater than 20 miles' distance from the studio, there is an additional cost for
              travel.
